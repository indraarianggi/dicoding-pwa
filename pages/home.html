                        The <b>Premier League</b>, often referred to as the
                        <b>English Premier League</b> or the <b>EPL</b> outside
                        England, is the top level of the English football league
                        system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system
                        of promotion and relegation with the English Football
                        League (EFL). Seasons run from August to May with each
                        team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both
                        home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and
                        Sunday afternoons.

                        The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on
                        20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the
                        Football League First Division to break away from the
                        Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of
                        a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth
                        around £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14,
                        with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to
                        broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The league is a
                        corporation in which the member clubs act as
                        shareholders, and generates €2.2 billion per year in
                        domestic and international television rights. Clubs were
                        apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in
                        2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity
                        payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.

                        Forty-nine clubs have competed since the inception of
                        the Premier League in 1992: forty-seven English and two
                        Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title:
                        Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City
                        (4), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City
                        (1) and Liverpool (1) with Liverpool being the most
                        recent winners. The record of most points in a Premier
                        League season is 100, set by Manchester City in 2017–18.

                    <p>
                        In the early 1990s, English First Division clubs
                        believed that a radical restructuring of football was
                        needed if they and the game in general were to develop
                        and flourish. So on 17 July 1991, they signed the
                        Founder Members Agreement, establishing the basic
                        principles for the setting up of the Premier League. The
                        League would have commercial independence from the
                        Football League and The FA, leaving it free to organise
                        its own broadcast and sponsorship agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 20 February 1992, the 22 First Division clubs
                        resigned from the Football League en masse and three
                        months later, on 27 May, the Premier League was
                        established as a limited company.

                    <p>
                        The first television deal was struck with pay-TV
                        broadcaster BSkyB, a radical move at the time, but Sky
                        has been ever-present and has played a key role in
                        developing the League to its present levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inaugural Premier League campaign started on
                        Saturday 15 August, 1992, with 22 clubs. The 22
                        inaugural members of the new Premier League were
                        Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea,
                        Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town,
                        Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester
                        United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest,
                        Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United,
                        Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and
                        Wimbledon. Of these, six clubs have been ever-present in
                        the Premier League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton,
                        Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.

                        When the Premier League was formed, there was always the
                        intention to reduce the number of clubs to 20 to promote
                        development and excellence at club and international
                        level. This was achieved at the end of the 1994/95
                        season when four clubs were relegated and just two
                        promoted.
